Lazy Evaluations and Parallel Collections
-----------------------
In this project we see a few techniques and features in Scala that can make code execution faster and more efficient, the topics are:
* [Let's Get Lazy](https://github.com/robsonoduarte/learn-scala/blob/master/pragmatic-scala/lazy-evaluations-parallel-collections/src/main/scala/br/com/mystudies/scala/LetsGetLazy.scala)
* [Making Strict Collections Lazy](https://github.com/robsonoduarte/learn-scala/blob/master/pragmatic-scala/lazy-evaluations-parallel-collections/src/main/scala/br/com/mystudies/scala/MakingStrictCollectionsLazy.scala)
