From Java to Scala
======================

**Quick drive through Scala from the perspective of Java Programmers**

> Do in Scala everything you do in Java with less and more expressive syntax and more things that don't have in Java:


- Tuples
- Multiple-Assignments
- Named Arguments
- Default Values
- Implicit Parameters
- Multiline Strings
- String Interpolation
- Flexible Access Modifiers
